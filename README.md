Incomplete version of RedForce forcing set solver. Designed to be a superset of Redforce where it can solve binary and non-binary vertex graphs with a set of Forcing Set rules.

To-Do:

1. Redo GUI. The current GUI was just a prototype.
2. Redo Forcing Set rules.
3. Redo or remove Driver program entirely and create GUI based Driver.
4. Redo Solver code
